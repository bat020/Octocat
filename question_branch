branch

Any changes made to code in a repository take place on a particular branch,
initially the master branch. Creating a new branch allows the coder to insulate
any changes from other branches. Alternative solutions can be trialled this way,
or distinct and independent update tasks parcelled between different team members.
Branches can later be merged back together, or back into the master, providing
of course that the changes made on them are compatible with each other.
