"upstream" remote

The "upstream" remote is a repository, typically on a server or a site such
as github, that serves as a common or public store for the coding project.
Often several collaborators will update changes they have made locally to
the common remote repository. Conversely, changes made on the upstream remote
can be pulled back down to the local machine to be worked upon.
