git clone [location]

This finds the repository at [location], either locally or on a remote site 
such as github. It then creates a directory with that name, and copies the 
repository into that directory. It leaves the original repository intact and
creates a fresh one in the new location. The original repository is tagged
as a remote called 'origin'.
